SO, I'm learning more about basic commands and why they work the way they do. 
$PATH is the variable that controls the commands.

ENV is for environmental variable; you can use 'env' to list ALL of them. They are configuration knobs for programs. 
They allow same program, different behavior, without changing code.

LIST OF COMMON REAL VARIABLES
-PATH = command discovery (think arcane stat in Elden Ring)
-HOME = user home directory
-USER = is the current user
-SHELL = which shell script (like BASH)
-AWS_REGION = cloud region
-AWS_PROFILE = which credentials
-PYTHONPATH = python imports
-KUBECONFIG = kubernetes access
-DATABASE_URL = Database connections

Later I'll learn about potential risks when it comes to PATH and env variables, such as misconfigured PATH = privilege escalation RISK.

ALWAY INSPECT YOUR TERMINAL ENVIRONMENTS!
PATH decides what runs, ENV decides how it runs. 

You can then ask 'which' to a command to identify and learn where it comes from. 

Going further into day four of week 1, you ALWAYS want to check your command sources to AVOID running potentially malicious scripts.
-which python, which bash, which sudo.
All of these things can be manipulated by an attacker using a mal script earlier in PATH, common ones like ls, ssh, sudo.

WHAT I LEARNED FROM A PATH ATTACK (and what to look out for)
