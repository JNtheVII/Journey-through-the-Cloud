PATH is an ordered list of directories searched for commands.
Linux runs the first match it finds. 
Scripts need execute permissions. ./script runs from current directory; to modify, use export PATH="$HOME/directory:$PATH"
NOTE* the modification reverts to original aftewr closing the terminal.
PATH manipulation is a common attack vector.
ALWAYS check ad verify your languages and privileges (SUDO).

SO when you do NOT have certain command installed, the PATH search can fail, because Linux is supposed to be minimal.

SUDO is run this command as an admin (root): it is basically linux God. 
-root: can delete systems, change users, modify sec settings, install software, control services.
NOTE* normal users cannot do this UNLESS they utilize sudo to TEMPORARILY borrow the root power.

NOTE* normal users are the standard for beginners because its much safer (as not to delete something accidentally).
sudo gives privileges ONLY when NEEDED. ties into the principle of least privilege (the less amount of people who have permissions to access or modify things, the safer a network/system can run) 

in other words, the less privileges, the less you can really mess up.

SO I learned how to create commands, run them, and why using PATH can be a security risk in the form of malicious script being guised as something such as ls, ssh, or sudo.
