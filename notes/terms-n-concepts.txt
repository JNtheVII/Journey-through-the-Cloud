Terms (aka tools for writing bash code)

pwd = where am I currently at, ls = whats inside this current directory, cd = change directory, cd .. = exit out of current directory,
directory = folders, mkdir = create a directory, touch = create a file, rm = delete files, rmdir =  delete directory, 
rm -r = delete a non empty directory, -ri = confirmation, -rf = forced deletion (common security risk), clear =  clean the screen, nano = open a file, 
cat = read a file, less = read a file without scrolling.

So far these are the terms and concepts I have been using to learn the fundamentals of linux (Feb 2 2026). These have been usefuls in understanding how to navigate the terminal without needing to google everything.

-echo = print text, -ps = list current running processes (stands for process status), -ps aux = all running processes, who owns them, cpu and memory storage, top = real time monitoring tool for linux (shows CPU usage, meomory usage) M to sort by memory, K to kill a process and Q to quit.

Process is a program in the background. A PID is a process id number. A job number is a shell specific number for background tasks. Foreground process take up active use of the terminal until completion while background process leave the terminal open for activity aka typing.

-grep is used to filter for a specific running processes.

cp = copy, -r = recursive (copies all files and subdirectories inside it without error)
