Hello, world from a previous mistake!
I learned that Linux does NOT have a recycling bin and NOT to have two files have the same name before moving one into a directory with the other.
This script is running as user: jnthevii
This is the current directory: /home/jnthevii/engineering/labs
This is the home directory: /home/jnthevii
Learning from our mistakes makes us better!
