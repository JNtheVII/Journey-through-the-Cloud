# Engineering Learning Lab

This directory contains my hands-on Linux and Cloud Engineering practice.

## Structure
- scripts/   = executable scripts (bash/python)
- labs/      = lab writeups with steps and outcomes
- notes/     = raw notes during practice
- summaries/ = weekly summary writeups
- logs/      = saved command outputs and session captures

## Goal
Build strong Linux, networking, security, and cloud fundamentals with reproducible labs.
